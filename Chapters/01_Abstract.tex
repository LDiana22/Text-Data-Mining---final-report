In this project, we apply various machine learning and data mining techniques on textual data for the task of sentiment analysis. This report discusses the proposed approaches for both the classification task and for the unsupervised keyword extraction task (text mining). For classification, we report the results obtained using Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, and MLP. The results show that SVM outperforms the other two methods we used in our experiment. For the unsupervised task of text mining, we compare the performance of different key-phrase extraction algorithms, by building a novel architecture that selects the phrase with the highest influence on the classification task, when added to the input of a bi-LSTM classifier. We compare the results obtained on this new task using the labelled sentences and present a discussion about the proposed methodology and the conclusions of our experiments.
