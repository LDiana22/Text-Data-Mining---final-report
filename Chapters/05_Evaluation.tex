\subsection{Classification}
For the classification task, we have reported the results in Table \ref{tab:evaluation}.
\begin{table}[!htb]
  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    &Accuracy&Sensitivity&Specificity&Precision&AUC\\
    \hline
    Naïve Bayes&82.17\%&84\%&81\%&81\%&89.89\%\\
    \hline
    SVM&83.67\%&85\%&83\%&83\%&91.19\%\\
    \hline
    MLP&77.33\%&76\%&79\%&80\%&85\%\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Classification evaluation}
    \label{tab:evaluation}
\end{table}

SVM outperformed both Naïve Bayes and MLP in all the metrics reported, the F1 score (0.84) also being the highest among all models. This indicates that SVM has certian robustness against the other two models. To further prove that SVM outperforms the other models, we have analyzed the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves that can be found in the Appendices.
