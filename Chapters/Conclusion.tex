Our project presents the application of machine learning algorithms that are traditionally used on numerical data on a text classification task for sentiment analysis. We discover the TF-IDF vectors are separable in the hyperspace defined by them, SVM performing very well. 
We not only report the results obtained with algorithms from different classes: probabilistic, linear, and neural networks, but also introduce a new evaluation technique for the unsupervised task of keyword extraction. We thus implement and discuss the results obtained using statistical approaches of text mining, combined with advanced deep learning techniques for text processing.

Our work can be further extended in the area of Explainable AI (XAI), where the mined key-phrases act as explanations of the deep learning classifier.
